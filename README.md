Bytes for Java
==============

This library aims to provide a Bytes class which models an immutable
sequence of bytes, and to provide efficient, reduced copying primitives
around that type as well as conversions to and from other existing
Java types.

This library aims to otherwise have a minimal scope and zero runtime
dependencies, to encourage reuse as part of third party projects.
